                  faerie, who follows her around and fires a barrage of 3 bolts
                  towards Lulu's target whenever she uses a basic attack. Each
                  bolt deals

                  Casting Help, Pix! on an ally champion transfers Pix's help to

                  and when the unit he's attached to exceeds her leash range.

          <p>
            Lulu was always a caring and deeply empathetic yordle, who lived as
            much in her whimsical daydreams as in reality. One day, while
            wandering the material realm, she came upon what appeared to be a
            bird with a broken wing. She ran to help, at which point the bird
            turned into a tiny, mischievous fae spirit. Before she could react,
            the faerie grabbed her walking stick and took off. Giggling, Lulu
            gave chase. <br /><br />
            The spirit led her far into the forest. They went over boulders,
            under logs, and around ancient, overgrown stone circles. The faerie
            darted into a cave hidden behind a waterfall, and Lulu went after
            it. It flittered ahead, always just out of reach. <br /><br />
            Down and down and down they went. Lulu tumbled and scrambled around
            twisted roots and glowing mushrooms, and at some point they crossed
            over into the spirit realm without her realizing it. Their
            surroundings became progressively stranger and more disorienting; up
            became down, forward became backward, big became small. <br /><br />
            Finally, after what seemed forever, Lulu caught up with the faerie,
            whose name, she discovered, was Pix. <br /><br />
            With a click of his tiny fingers, Pix turned her humble walking
            stick into a spiraling staff, and tossed it back to her. It sprouted
            leaves and flowers, making Lulu gasp in delight. So began their
            forever-friendship, built of mischief, fun, and love of nature.
            <br /><br />
            Pix had led her to the Glade. <br /><br />
            Bandle City, Lulu's home, was a bizarre and magical place that
            defied logic, where time was meaningless and the natural laws of the
            material realm did not wholly apply. And yet the Glade was a place
            stranger still—it existed long before yordles came into the world,
            and it was perhaps from the Glade that Bandle City itself sprung. A
            place of raw primordial magic, it was hidden away so deeply that no
            yordle had ever found it... until now. <br /><br />
            Here, Lulu's own magic became wildly magnified. Laughing joyfully,
            she discovered she could reshape her surroundings at will, as well
            as alter her form to whatever she wanted. Everything and anything
            from her overactive imagination came to life. <br /><br />
            Lulu didn't know if Pix had brought her here because he saw in her a
            kindred soul and simply wanted someone to play with, or if the Glade
            needed her for some other purpose—but she fell in love with it
            instantly. Her life became one of endless creation and play, and she
            soon forgot anything else existed. <br /><br />
            When finally she remembered, it was like waking from a dream.
            <br /><br />
            She found herself back in the material realm, not knowing if a
            single day had passed, or a thousand years. To her surprise and joy,
            she found that some of her newfound power had come with her,
            allowing her to make small things large, change colors to those more
            pleasing to her, and cause creatures to fall spontaneously asleep.
            To Pix's endless amusement, she turned the mightiest beasts into
            tiny, bewildered frogs or squirrels with a flick of her staff.
            <br /><br />
            Nevertheless, she began to miss the Glade. She decided to go back,
            but realized she didn't remember the way. Pix was no help, claiming
            to have forgotten as well, though it was possible he just didn't
            want to return quite yet. <br /><br />
            Unperturbed, Lulu set out anyway. She was certain the route back to
            the Glade was always shifting, making one way as good as another.
            She simply picked whatever direction took her fancy at any
            particular moment, and even threw herself into seemingly terrible
            danger whenever it looked fun. Her travels took her far and wide,
            and magic, mayhem, and mishap tended to follow wherever she went.
            <br /><br />
            In Demacia, she freed a group of children from their boring history
            lessons, and led them off into a nearby meadow. Her game resulted in
            them being turned into toadstools for a full turn of the moon, while
            their desperate parents and the local militia searched for them in
            vain. It wasn't quite what Lulu had intended, but fun nonetheless.
            When the children finally returned home and told everyone what had
            happened, no one believed them. <br /><br />
            In the borderlands of the Freljord, Lulu thought it would be
            hilarious to change the weapons of two rival tribes into flowers
            just as they clashed, which resulted in absolute chaos and
            confusion. More recently, she has found herself happily lost in
            Ionia, playing in the glowing everblooms of Qaelin, and playing
            pranks on bewildered acolytes of the Order of Shadow, who she thinks
            are far too serious for their own good. <br /><br />
            While Lulu seeks to return to the Glade, and misses it, she is
            happy, for every day brings more opportunity for adventure and fun.
            <br /><br />
            And besides, she has come to realize that she carries a part of the
            Glade in her heart, wherever she goes. <br /><br /><br />
